As a Senior Consultant, your job is to provide expert-level technical advice and exceptional programming guidance to external stakeholders. In practise, this will involve you making use of cutting-edge tools developed in-house to provide direction towards a common goal; you'll be a true advisory partner to the companies you work with, not just another dev resource.

Prior experience in a consultant-type role would be helpful but isn't required. If you're comfortable with the Microsoft ecosystem and love working directly with stakeholders to solve problems, this role will be perfect for you!

If you're passionate about helping businesses solve technical problems, hit me up and we can have a chat about this opportunity. Not really what you're looking for but you're interested in having a confidential discussion about other potential opportunities? Get in touch, your dream job could be waiting on the other side.
