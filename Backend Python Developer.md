# Backend Python Developer

Hi Harold,

My name is Ivan, I'm an Ultra Risky Self-respecting Number Crunching Senior Python Developer who was impressed by your job descriptions and decided to apply to the position below in the form of this pull request.

I have about 10 years experience, mostly with web using Python and Django, but I have also worked on some C++ projects, commercial as well as my own for fun (see my github profile).

I'm currently based in Wellington, New Zealand, but I'm looking for a job in Australia, while I'm in the process of obtaining an AU resident visa (may take up to a year), so I need work visa sponsorship from the employer for the time being.

I am including my CV in this pull request, please have a look. I'm looking forward to talking to you.

Yours,
Ivan
