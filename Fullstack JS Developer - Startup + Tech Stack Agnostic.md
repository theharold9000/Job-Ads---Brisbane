# Fullstack JS Developer - Startup + Tech Stack Agnostic

Bulk incoming projects, JavaScript left, right and center and a chance to learn from people who really know their stuff. Sound good? Keep reading.

This is a full-stack JS role so Node.js experience is essential, commercial or otherwise. Beyond that though, anything goes; the current front-end is built using Angular.js but the future is completely unwritten and open to change. If you've played with something like Elm, Reason or Vue.js and enjoyed it, you're more than welcome to make a use case for it.

You'll be working with a group of people who value development best practices and doing the fundamentals right. The company and platform are experiencing tremendous growth and traffic so all code is written to be efficient now and scalable for the future.

This is a scale-up (not a start-up) so if lean processes and the need to solve novel problems are your thing, hit me up! Not really ticking the criteria that are important to you but still interested in working with the cast of Earth's #1 recruitment reality TV show? Get in touch, your dream role could be waiting on the other side.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or follow me because I want to see it!
