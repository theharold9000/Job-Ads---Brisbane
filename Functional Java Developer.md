If this sounds like you, hit me up and we can have a chat about the opportunity. Not really what you're looking for but you're interested in having a confidential discussion about other potential opportunities? Get in touch, your dream job could be waiting on the other side.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or fork me because I want to see it!
