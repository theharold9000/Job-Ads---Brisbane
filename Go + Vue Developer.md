I'm currently looking for full-stack developers to be part of a groundbreaking greenfields project. You will participate in developing both backend API's and innovative user interfaces for a company committed to changing the way software engineering teams operate. 

This isn't some university group project, they aren't looking for 'rockstar' developers to come aboard and do 80% of the heavy lifting. You'll be joining an organisation that expects bright people and treats them as such; get handed complex problems and be expected to come up with a smart solution while working with other smart people.

**What you will be doing**
* Create clean and efficient custom APIs and micro-services.
* Implement intuitive user interfaces. 
* Be involved in laying the foundations of a truly exciting platform.

**What will be be asked of you**
* Experience with or a strong practical interest in learning Go, Vue.js or both.
* Great eye for detail and strong sense of responsibility. 
* The ambition to develop well written and designed software. 
* The ability to make smart decisions and just get things done. 

**What's on offer**
* The chance to be part of a meaningful challenge. 
* Competitive salary.
* An opportunity to learn and work with great technologies.

If this sounds like you, hit me up and we can have a chat about the opportunity. Not really what you're looking for but you're interested in having a confidential discussion about other potential opportunities? Get in touch, your dream job could be waiting on the other side.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or fork me because I want to see it!
